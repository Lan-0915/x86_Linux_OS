# x86_Linux_OS

Implement a small 32-bit x86 operating system with approximately 6,000 lines of code. The system functions are as follows:
Support multi-process operation;
Support the shell to load and run applications on the disk;
Support virtual memory management to achieve isolation between processes;
Support for keyboard and display;
Referencing the standard C library makes application development more convenient;
More than ten system calls: fork(), execve(), open(), write(), exit(), etc;
The process is separated from the operating system at different privilege levels.
